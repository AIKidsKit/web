# About

We are looking to create a kit which you can take to your child (aged 8-15) to introduce him/her to the concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The kit will include:

* Graphical content to explain main AI concepts through storytelling
* An exercise of using Lobe AI to train image classification model

As part of the hackathon, we want to:

* Create a story and graphical content that will appeal to kids
* Explore the options of using Lobe.ai together with other kid-friendly tools, such as Scratch, Blockly, Microsoft Code, Minecraft (Edu) etc. We want kids to be able to create programs that react to images recognized by Lobe.ai model.
* If options do not work, we will create a simple standalone app to program actions of virtual on-screen robot reacting to different recognized images

How this will help promote Azure?

* We hope this content will appeal to developers who can bring it home to teach their kids
* We will include links to developer AI content on MS Learn
* To work fully, the project will need to use cognitive services for speech synthesis, which will require a parent to create a resource in Azure subscription
