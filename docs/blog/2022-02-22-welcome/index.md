Welcome to our Fix/Hack/Learn project site. We built this site with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/).

Our custom font was designed by a 13-year-old and turned into a webfont with [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).

We recommend getting started by first learning about [AI concepts](/docs/concepts), and then checking out some [zines](/docs/concepts/zines).
