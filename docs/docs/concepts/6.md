![Layers of AI](./img/5.png)

Human beings have two 'layers' of intelligence that is similar to the two types of AI: subconscious intelligence, (like neural networks) and conscious intelligence (like rule-based reasoning). Suppose you want to buy something for lunch. You first see what's available on the menu, and then start reasoning what you should eat to depending on your mood. Finally, you turn to your subconscious intelligence when you start ordering food with your voice.
