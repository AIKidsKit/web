Bots can make your life a little easier! You can use your bot to help you with your daily tasks, or to help you with your daily chores.

Use a bot to tell your parents which food you like or don't like.

Use a bot to count how many cups of tea you have had.

Use gestures to program a bot to say different things. You can even teach a bot sign language!
