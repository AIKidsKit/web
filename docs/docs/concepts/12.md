# Simulate a Bot

---

 ![Simulate a Bot](./img/11.png)

You can make a rules-based robot simulator by creating a list of rules that your robot needs to follow. An example would be:

When shown an apple, the bot smiles. 

When shown a pen or pencil, the bot says, "let's get ready for homework".

If an apple is shown more than once to the bot, the bot frowns and says, "I have had enough apples today!" 

If a pen has been shown more than once, the bot can say, "I have seen this pen `<this number>` of times".
