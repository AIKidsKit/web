# Learn Together

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are all around us. From self-driving cars to apps that can recognize you in a photo, we interact with AI every day. For kids and adults, learning about AI can help you get a better understanding of the world around you and ask questions. Creating AI robots can also be a lot of fun!

## Kids Corner

Have you ever wanted to figure out what you might look like in 30 years or better understand how self-driving cars work? Do you run into decisions every day that you wish you could make easier? AI is the tool for you.

## Parents Corner

Learning about how AI works will help prepare your kids for the future. In addition to exposing your child you programming concepts, your helping them learn how to solve problems and teaching them to be a digital citizen. Most importantly, you are helping them become a smart consumer of technology who is digitally curious and critical and can ask good questions.

## Teachers Corner

We're using the learning objective standards from [MIT's AI Ethics Education Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9wx9oBg7CR0s5O7YnYHVmX7H7pnITfoDxNdrSGkp60/edit#). Each of our lessons corresponds to a set of standards.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the basic mechanics of artificial intelligence systems.
    * a. Recognize algorithms in the world and be able to give examples of computer algorithms and algorithms in everyday contexts (for example, baking a cake).
    * b. Know three parts of an algorithm: input, steps to change input, output. 
    * c. Know that artificial intelligence is a specific type of algorithm and has three specific parts: dataset, learning algorithm, and prediction.
    * d. Recognize AI systems in everyday life and be able to reason about the prediction an AI system makes and the potential datasets the AI system uses.
2. Understand that all technical systems are socio-technical systems. Understand that socio-technical systems are not neutral sources of information and serve political agendas.
    * a. Understand the term “optimization” and recognize that humans decide the goals of the socio-technical systems they create.
    * b. Reason about the goals of socio-technical systems in everyday life and distinguish advertised goals from true goals (for example, the YouTube recommendation algorithm aims to make profit for the company, while it is advertised as a way to entertain users).
    * c. Know the term “algorithmic bias” in the classification context.
3. Recognize that humans have agency in curating training datasets.
    * a. Identify relevant stakeholders in an socio-technical system.
    * b. Justify why an individual stakeholder is concerned about the outcome of a socio-technical system. 
    * c. Identify values an individual stakeholder has in an socio-technical system, e.g. explain what goals the system should hold in order to meet the needs of a user. 
    * d. Construct an ethical matrix around a socio-technical system.
4. Apply both technical understanding of AI and knowledge of stakeholders in order to determine a just goal for a socio-technical system.
    * a. Analyze an ethical matrix and leverage analysis to consider new goals for a socio-technical system.
    * b. Identify dataset(s) needed to train an AI system to achieve said goal.
    * c. Design features that reflect the identified goal of the socio-technical system or reflect the stakeholder’s values. 
5. Consider the impact of technology on the world.
    * a. Reason about secondary and tertiary effects of a technology’s existence and the circumstances the technology creates for various stakeholders.
